    "### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, today our goal is simply to extend our understanding of context-free grammars to include a notion of probability. In order to do this activity, you'll need to have completed the CKY activity from last time, so if you haven't, take time to complete, at minimum, your `CKYRecognizer` function. If you've given writing CKY a fair attempt and could use a reference implementation to check your understanding, you may study the implementation provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw in the reading and lecture, adding probabilities to CFGs can be motivated through *structural ambiguity*: When we generate from our grammar --- as you saw two activities ago! --- we sometimes have to make choices about which rule to apply. In the CFG activity, I told you to choose a rule *uniformly at random*. This is an assignment of probabilities to CFG generations! All we're doing now is allowing those to vary, and updating our parser to compute the probabilities we associate with each parse!"

    "1. Below is a new grammar class describing PCNFGs (Probabilistic Chomsky-Normal Form Grammars). Take a moment to look through the provided methods (including the new `verify` function that is used to check whether the conditional probabilities sum to 1) and make sure you understand how things are represented. Note that the probabilities are supplied to the model as *raw* probabilities. Remember that once you start doing computations, you should make sure they're done as *log-probabilities!*\n",
